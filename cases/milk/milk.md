### Fitting demand curves

For this exercise, you'll need to download the following data set:   
* [milk.csv](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/data/milk.csv)  

The data in [milk.csv](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/data/milk.csv) contains a random sample of daily sales figures for a small neighborhood grocery store of cartons of milk.  (Think of something like Fresh Plus in West Campus or Hyde Park.)  The "price" column gives the price at which the milk was sold that day; the "sales" column says how many units were sold that day.

Here's the key question.  Let's say that the store's wholesale cost of milk is c dollars per carton.  If you were the merchant and wanted to maximize profit, how much would you charge for a carton of milk, in light of the information on supply and demand conveyed by the data?  Explain your thought process carefully, and express your final answer as an equation in terms of c.

Now suppose that the per-unit cost c is $1.  What price should you charge, and how much net profit do you expect to make at this price?  

Here are some key points to think about as your structure your thought process.  

1) Say that the per-unit price charged is P, and the quantity of units sold is Q.  Can you write an equation that expresses net profit N in terms of both Q and P (and the per-unit cost, c)?  

2) The store can choose what price P to charge for milk in order to maximize profit, and consumers then decide what quantity Q they are willing to buy at that given price.  Can you write an equation that expresses your best guess about how many units Q will be sold at a given price P?  Hint: use the data!  Remember the discussion of demand curves in the section on fitting nonlinear curves in the course packet. 

3) Can you combine steps 1 and 2 to yield an equation for net profit N _in terms of price P and cost c_ alone?  In other words, Q should not appear in your equation.  

4) Finally, in light of 3, how can we calculate the price P that maximizes profit for a given per-unit cost c?
