### Market model  

For this exercise, you'll need to download the marketmodel.csv data set from the class website.


(A) Regress the returns for each of the 6 stocks individually on the return of S&P 500.  Which stock seems to be the most tightly coupled to the movements of the wider market?

(B) What do you notice about the intercepts? Are they mostly small, or mostly large? Interpret these intercepts in terms of whether any of the individual stocks appear to be outperforming the market.

(C) Does your estimate of the slope for Wal-Mart versus the S&P 500 agree (roughly) with the “beta” reported by Yahoo Finance?2 If you notice a discrepancy, offer a possible explanation.

(D) Assess the evidence in the data for the following claim: “Even after adjusting for their shared dependence on the broader market, we should expect Wal-Mart’s stock market returns to be most closely related to Target’s returns than with any of the other four firms, because they are both large retailers.” (Hint: Consider the 6 models you fit in Part (A). Each model leads to a set of residuals for one particular stock. Which set of residuals has the largest correlation with the residuals for the model having Wal-Mart as the response variable? Why do you think this is so?)
