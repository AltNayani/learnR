## R Walkthroughs

### Introduction to R
* [Installing R](basics/installing_R.md): installing R and RStudio.  
* [Heights of students versus their parents](heights/heights.md): a "hello world"-style introduction to the R environment.  
* [Installing a library](basics/installing_library.md): installing the mosaic library from within RStudio.  


### Exploratory data analysis
* [Survival on the Titanic](titanic/titanic.md): basics of contingency tables.  
* [Temperatures in San Diego and Rapid City](citytemps/citytemps.md): measuring and visualizing dispersion; changing default plots in R.
* [SAT scores and GPA at UT-Austin](sat/sat.md): boxplots, between-group and within-group variation, sample correlation, scatter plots, pairs plots, and lattice plots.    

### Fitting equations to data
* [Asking prices of pickup trucks on Craigslist](pickup/pickup.md): simple linear regression via ordinary least squares; residual summaries   
* [Utility bills versus temperature](utilities/utilities.md): adding polynomial terms to fit nonlinear curves  
* [Infant mortality and GDP](infmort/infmort.md): using log transformations to fit power laws via linear least squares      

### Predictable and unpredictable variation  
* [Kidney function and aging](creatinine/creatinine.md): naive prediction intervals; R^2 and the decomposition of variance     

### Regression with multiple categorical variables  
* [Reaction time in video games](rxntime/rxntime.md): modeling numerical outcomes with more than one categorical predictor; dummy variables and interaction terms; analysis of variance.  
* [House prices](house/house.md): regression with one numerical and multiple categorical predictors; dummy variables and interactions in simple regression models.  


### Quantifying uncertainty: the basics   
* [Gone fishing](gonefishing/gonefishing.md): using the Monte Carlo method to simulate the sampling distributions of the sample mean and of the least-squares estimator  
* [Kidney function and aging, revisited](creatinine/creatinine_bootstrap.md): bootstrapping the sample mean and the OLS estimator; computing confidence intervals from bootstrapped samples.  
* [Newspapers](newspapers/newspapers.md): using the normal linear regression model to quantify uncertainty about parameters and predictions.    
* [Titanic, revisited](titanic/titanic_permtest.md): relative risk, odds ratios, and permutation tests in 2x2 contingency tables.  


### Multiple regression  
* [The wage gap](salary/salary.md): an introduction to multiple regression  
* [Current population survey](cps/cps.md): ANOVA tables in multiple regression models; stepwise selection using AIC  
* [Google flu trends](flu/flu.md): Building and checking a predictive model
